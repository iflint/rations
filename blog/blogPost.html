		<h2>Macronutrients</h2>

		<p>The food we eat is primarily composed of three major macronutrients, protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Macronutrient ratios are very important to a healthy diet, so I thought it would be interesting to take a closer look at some data.</p>

		<p>Using the USDA's food nutrition database, we can visualize the macronutrient composition of food with the help of tools like SQL and R. The 3d scatter plot shows how many grams of each macronutrient are contained within each food. Additionally, the points are color coded to show how many total calories are in the food per 100g.</p>
